# keystore
Powershell scripts for encrypting and decrypting data using an X.509 certificate.

## background

I finally got tired of rewriting the same powershell encryption functions over and over again, so from now on I'll just save these here so I can easily find them the next time I need them. The name 'keystore' is a reference to the encryption script module we wrote at my first workplace, which inspired me to write these scripts in the first place.
